Assignment: "fertility of Arabidopsis
The dataset "Aribidopsis" (available in file arabidopsis.csv) was collected to study the fertility of Arabidopsis thaliana according to certain variables. The experiment involved two variables of particular interest: the first one is a fertilization treatment, and the second one involves simulated herbivory (plants were "clipped" to mimic the effect of an herbivore eating part of the plant).

 The detail of the variables is as follows:

    ‘reg’ region: a factor indicating where the plant comes from (‘NL’ (Netherlands), ‘SP’ (Spain), or ‘SW’ (Sweden))
    ‘popu’ population: a factor with the form ‘n.R’ representing a population in region ‘R’
    ‘gen’ genotype: a factor with 24 (numeric-valued) levels
    ‘rack’ a nuisance factor with 2 levels, one for each of two greenhouse racks
    ‘nutrient’ fertilization treatment/nutrient level (1, minimal nutrients or 8, added nutrients)
    ‘amd’ simulated herbivory or "clipping" (apical meristem damage): ‘unclipped’ (baseline) or ‘clipped’
    ‘status’ a nuisance factor for germination method (‘Normal’, ‘Petri.Plate’, or ‘Transplant’)
    ‘total.fruits’ total fruit set per plant (integer) is our measure of fertility (response variable)

Write a report describing the data, and identifying the factors that influence the fertility.

Your report should be targetted at a biologist who has an idea about statistics: he/she will understand the models you are going to use and wants to know about them, but does not need all the details (these should be provided in an appendix)
