2. Stroke data

The "stroke" dataset (available in package ISwR) contains details about all cases of stroke in Tartu, Estonia, during the period 1991-1993, with follow-up until 1 January 1996, along with information on several covariables.

Write a report assessing the effect of these covariables on the survival of these patients.

In particular, you may notice that when you assess the affect of the "sex" variable alone, you get a different results that when assessing it in conjunction with the "age" variable. Can you explain the difference ?
