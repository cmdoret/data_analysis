# Introduction

In this report, I assess the effect of covariables on the survival of some subjects.

# Data

I used the 'stroke' dataset, available in the ISwR package.

```{r load_data, echo=T}
library(ISwR)
data(stroke)
```

This dataset contains 10 variables observed on 829 individuals who were followed after a stroke episode.

The variables in the dataset are:
  * sex: 
  * died: 
  * dstr: 
  * age: 
  * dgn: 
  * coma: 
  * diab: 
  * minf: 
  * han: 
  * obsmonths:
  * dead:
